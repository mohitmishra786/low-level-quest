# Low-Level Quest Executor System Documentation

## Overview

The Low-Level Quest executor system is a modular framework designed to execute and evaluate code submissions for various programming domains. Each executor is specialized to handle specific types of problems and provides domain-specific analysis, visualization, and feedback.

## Architecture

The executor system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Base Executor**: A common interface that all specialized executors extend
2. **Specialized Executors**: Domain-specific implementations for different problem types
3. **Docker Containers**: Isolated environments for secure code execution
4. **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for code submission and result retrieval

## Common Features Across Executors

All executors share the following common features:

1. **Code Execution**: Secure execution of user-submitted code
2. **Test Case Validation**: Running code against predefined test cases
3. **Resource Management**: Proper allocation and cleanup of resources
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting
5. **Visualization**: Domain-specific visualizations of code execution
6. **Metrics Collection**: Gathering performance and quality metrics
7. **Security**: Sandboxed execution environment

## Integration with Docker

Each executor runs in a specialized Docker container to ensure:

1. **Isolation**: Code execution is isolated from the host system
2. **Security**: Limited access to system resources
3. **Consistency**: Uniform execution environment
4. **Scalability**: Easy deployment and scaling

## API Integration

Executors are integrated with the main application through RESTful APIs:

```
POST /api/execute
{
  "problemId": "string",
  "code": "string",
  "language": "string",
  "executorType": "string"
}
```

Response:
```
{
  "success": boolean,
  "output": "string",
  "error": "string",
  "executionTime": number,
  "metrics": object,
  "visualizations": array
}
```

## Development and Extension

### Adding a New Executor

To add a new executor:

1. Create a new directory in `backend/executors/`
2. Implement a class that extends `BaseExecutor`
3. Create a Dockerfile in `backend/executors/docker/`
4. Add the executor to the Docker Compose configuration
5. Update the API to support the new executor type

### Customizing an Existing Executor

To customize an existing executor:

1. Modify the executor class in its respective directory
2. Update the Dockerfile if additional dependencies are needed
3. Update tests to cover new functionality

## Best Practices

1. **Security**: Always execute code in isolated containers
2. **Performance**: Optimize resource usage and execution time
3. **Error Handling**: Provide clear and helpful error messages
4. **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with changes

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Execution Timeout**: Increase the timeout value in the executor configuration
2. **Memory Issues**: Adjust the memory limits in the Docker configuration
3. **Compilation Errors**: Check the language support and compiler configuration
4. **Test Case Failures**: Verify the test case format and expected output

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the executor system:

1. **Real-time Execution**: Live code execution with immediate feedback
2. **Collaborative Execution**: Multi-user code execution and review
3. **Advanced Visualizations**: Interactive visualizations of code execution
4. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automated code review and suggestions
5. **Extended Language Support**: Support for more programming languages
